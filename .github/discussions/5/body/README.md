# Help ALGOL 60 recover from CODEVID-19

This discussion page is for supporting the ALGOL 60 programming language recover from CODEVID-19 at the international code hospital. Here, you can leave nice comments, chat, and more. Leave a like if you support the ALGOL 60 programming language, leave a dislike if you don't.

ALGOL 60 is elderly, and is at higher risk of dying from CODEVID-19

**Disclaimer: the code hospital and codevid-19 are joke concepts for this project and are not real. Computer programs cannot get infected with medical diseases, this theme is meant to be a joke that helps raise awareness for the bad times we are in.**
