The SQL programming language is code distancing due to posssible contact with CODEVID-19.

[Support SQL in the code hospital](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Code-distancing/discussions/6)

## Doctors notes

[1] Doctors note: be careful with [injections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection). SQL does not like injections. Make sure to [sanitize his tables](https://xkcd.com/327/) before injecting with the vaccine.

## Technical

The code hospital and CODEVID-19 are joke terms meant to raise awareness on the pandemic and encourage people to continue social distancing, wearing a mask, and being safe.

This program is a basic SQL script modified to have every line 6 line breaks apart.
