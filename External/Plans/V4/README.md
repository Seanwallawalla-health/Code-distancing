# Code distancing February 28th 2021

## Plans for renovation:

* Support for more programming languages (Kotlin, Crystal, Handlebars, QML, etc.)

* Picture directory for each language directory

> * Each one will have: /Screenhots/: Gedit_Dark/ GitHub_Light/ NotepadPlusPlus_Light/ etc.

* Documentation about COVID-19 and social distancing

* Improved main README.md file

* README.md archives

* Mask_on and Mask_off file (#Mask-enabled) You have put on your masks. You are now a bit safer for your visit to the code terminal. To be even safer, make sure to also stay at least 6 feet (1.8288 meters, or 72 inches) away from the other script. (#Mask-disabled) You have disabled your mask. You should get out now and not go near the code terminal, unless you want to give yourself and others a terminal illness.
