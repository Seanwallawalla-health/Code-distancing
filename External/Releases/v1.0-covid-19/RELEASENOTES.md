This program is a joke program, but it is also being used to raise awareness of how dangerous COVID-19 really is. Please keep yourself and others safe during this time by wearing a mask (that **COMPLETELY** covers your mouth, and nose) and social distancing (by staying at least 6 feet apart) we can get through this if we try.
