# Developer vaccine

![Vaccine.png](Vaccine.png)

You have chosen to apply for the developer vaccine. This vaccine doubles in effectiveness and will treat against:

* COVID-19

* CODEVID-19

You will need to come back for a 2nd vaccine in 2 weeks. After the 2nd vaccine, it will take 5 more weeks to reach 95% effectiveness.

The CODEVID-19 Microsoft vaccine has been tested and proven to be 95% effective by the Linux medical organization. The Linux medical organization is now confirming that the CODEVID-19 vaccine does not contain any microchips, spyware, or the likes, although it has 3 syntax errors on line 8763.

You should still wear your mask until at least 85% of developers are vaccinated to create herd immunity and to be safer.
